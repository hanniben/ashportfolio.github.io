            <p>Little Bay was created as a final project for a film editing class. My gradfather often talks about the history of Little Bay. Between his memories and his own research that he has completed throughout the years, he paints a very detailed picture of what Little Bay was like. This film focuses on his personal connection to the area and what he felt as a young child.</p>
            <p>The film was recorded with a Sony Alpha .</p>
            <p>All video components were edited in Adobe Premiere. Sound was mixed in Adobe Audition.</p>
