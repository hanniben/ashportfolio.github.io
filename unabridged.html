            <img src="images/unabridged portfolio.png" alt="">
            <p>The site provides a suite of self-serve modules that explore a variety of topics related to academic research and publishing. The module content was adapted from presentations and activities offered as part of the in-person workshops.</p>
            <p>Each module offers some combination of prep work, presentations, activities, and further resources. The learning experience was designed to be comfortable and low-risk for an independent learner. WCAG 2.1 guidelines and inclusive phrasing were carefully considered throughout development.</p>
            <p>All page graphics were created with Adobe Illustrator. All page styles were coded in-line with CSS and HTML.</p>
            <p>The site is provided as a public course within the Canvas LMS.</p>
